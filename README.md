The last check would not go through and I dont know why. I spent so much time looking at the code to figure it out and it just would not go through. 

I spent a decent amount of time coding this section. I was able to also learn how to change some of the coding portions of the assignment in order to get the correct outputs, like the local storage and all. However, the app.logic will still not be recognized as completed on my end for some reason. 
### How long it took me to finish this?

## Discussion Questions:
